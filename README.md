# elixir-learning
In this repo I document my journey to learn elixir, as well its web-development framework Pheonix.
As elixir grows in popularity, resources about this technology become more and more relevant.
I hope this repo could be useful for some at the beginning of their journey, feel free to add under additional resources, whatever material you found useful!

## Useful Resources
- documentation: https://hexdocs.pm/elixir
- exercism: https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir
- pragmatic-studio: https://pragmaticstudio.com/phoenix-liveview

## Additional resources
- elixir-school: https://elixirschool.com/en

## Approach
Overall my approach to learning is very practice-oriented, these were my steps:

### Learning the basics of Elixir
1. Learning path available on exercism (done while looking at the documentation)
2. Taking notes on notion about the most fundamental topics (see link on the exercism/ex-guide.txt)
3. Doing more exercises available on exercism (always saved them under exercism)
4. Mini-projects (either invented by me or found on the web, I always put the sources)

### Learning Phoenix (LiveView)
1. Reading the documentation of phx
2. Starting with little projects understanding the structure of phx web apps
3. Following the Pragmatic Studio LiveView course

### Final Project
** in progress
